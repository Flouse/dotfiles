# Flouse's public dotfiles

## What is dotfiles?
Dotfiles are files and folders on Unix-like systems starting with `.` prefixed that control the configuration of applications and shells on your system. You can store and manage your dotfiles in a repository on GitHub. For advice and tutorials about what to include in your dotfiles repository, see [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

## Principles
No extra tooling, no symlinks,
files are tracked on a version control system,
you can use different branches for different computers,
you can replicate your configuration easily on new installation.
